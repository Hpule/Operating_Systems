# CSC 453 - Hector Pule

## Special Instructions
- I have a global called `TLB_SIZE` at the top, change it accordingly because I forgot about it and I was worried and confused why FIFO example w/ soft misses and tlb size 5, wasn't working - I set it to 16 and forgot. I'll probably have it set to 16, but change it for the sake of my grade.... (if you need to)
- Did not add executable to file \
- I have "\n" at the end of print_stats... might be a problem diff'ing files 

## Post Mortem
This assignment was equally fun and initially strange to understand at first. I had the most difficult time understanding the cache structure and really informing myself how the disk "Physical Memory" works, which helped me organize my data structures. 

To help me debug and "see" what was happening in my queue, I made a `print_tlb()` function to streamline my process. LRU and OPT were kinda weird because I need to make separate, yet joined structures in simulate and would handle them individually. 

I want to graduate... please.
