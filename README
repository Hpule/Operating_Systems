#### **Question 1 - For what types of workloads does SRTN deliver the same turnaround times as FIFO?**  
SRTN gives the same turnaround times as FIFO when all jobs arrive at the same time and have the same or increasing run times. No job gets preempted.

#### **Question 2 - For what types of workloads and quantum lengths does SRTN deliver the same response times as RR?**  
SRTN and RR give the same response times when all jobs arrive at once and have equal run times. There’s no preemption, and RR gives fair slices.

#### **Question 3 - What happens to response time with SRTN as job lengths increase? Can you use the simulator to demonstrate the trend?**  
As job lengths increase, long jobs are delayed if new short ones keep arriving. This causes longer response times or even starvation. The simulator can show this happening.

#### **Question 4 - What happens to response time with RR as quantum lengths increase? Can you write an equation that gives the worst-case response time, given N jobs?**  
As quantum increases, response time goes up. Worst-case response time is (N - 1) × Q, where N is number of jobs and Q is the quantum length.
