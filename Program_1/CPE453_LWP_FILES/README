# CSC 453 - Hector Pule 
### **Short Answer Questions**

#### **Question 1 - How is this LWP library different from a real thread management library?**

**Light Weight Processes (LWP):** n contrast to genuine thread libraries, which need kernel support for preemptive scheduling, this LWP library operates entirely non-preemptively. It only supports basic thread operations, has no synchronization primitives or sophisticated features, and uses direct assembly manipulation for context switching rather than system calls. A true thread management library would provide APIs, a way to optimize/monitor our performance, and security/error handling.

#### **Question 2 -  Name two ways in which this LWP library API or functionality could be improved.** 

**Enhanced Synchronization:** Adding mutexes and condition variables would enable thread coordination and prevent race conditions in concurrent applications.

**Imporoved Scalability:** Implementing preemption with priority levels would improve fairness or  responsiveness by preventing dominating CPU resources.

**Error Handling:** We currently do not implement error handling, adding it will increase performance.

### **Post Mark:**

My process for building this was to read the instructions several times and draw what I thought my code was doing. This is an example of what I drew to better understand what I was doing for this assignment. After I started using GDB to step through my code and see where I was seg faulting and slowly fixing my code. (Might have to change directory to work.)

For a long time, I was slowly losing my mind due to the -m32 flag. I ended up reading the lab manual and adding the flags, which made debugging go much more smoothly. Some of the areas I struggled with were new_lwp - just getting my head around the stack pointer structure, and understanding out why lwp_start failed after new_lwp passed.

I also attempted to get snake to function but encountered problems due to a missing "lncurses" library. I attempted to use the "sudo" command but received a bad-bad message from IT. (No emails from IT yet!!!)

```
hpule is not in the sudoers file. This  incident will be reported. 
```
After that, I attempted to download it to my local machine, upload the files to git, and manually install them in my files. That didn't work because I have an AMD CPU; I tried manually adding i386 but it didn't work, so I gave up.
