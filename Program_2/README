#### **Question 1 - For what types of workloads does SRTN deliver the same turnaround times as FIFO?**



#### **Question 2 - For what types of workloads and quantum lengths does SRTN deliver the same response times as RR?**



#### **Question 3 - What happens to response time with SRTN as job lengths increase? Can you use the simulator to demonstrate the trend?**

3) is starvation because thje jobs get longer and longer, the newer jobs take longer and longer to run


#### **Question 4 - What happens to response time with RR as quantum lengths increase? Can you write an equation that gives the worst-case response time, given N jobs?**

4) N*Q where Q is quant?
